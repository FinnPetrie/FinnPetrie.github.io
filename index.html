These site-specific sculptures function both as memories and as potential bio-scaffolds for new life. The project uses augmented reality to help understand the depth of time involved within the work, through an interactive gallery installation that simulates plant growth.

               <p class = "text-light">Works located near architecture demonstrate the project's emphasis on connectivity between humans, technology, and plants. In some instances the forms are based on LIDAR scans of buildings digitally merged with the shapes of ancient trees. This performs a sort of co-becoming, a means for us to think through, and pay respect to, the constant yet slow push between plants and the built environment, as well as to speculate on a new architecture – one that not only welcomes plants, but sees them as necessary cohabitants. These works (see below) appear like tree-architectural hybrids, and often have unprintable parts left behind from the surface reconstruction algorithm used in merging the structures. </p>

              <p class="text-light">Motivated by the notion of material hermeneutics, what philosopher Don Ihde describes as the interpretative practices of scientific visualisation, Retipora (A Network of Pores) was an early experiment within my practice exploring shared existences between biologies and digital technologies. A cloud of data-points visualising a rock-face within Ross Creek (Ōtepoti) is pushed through space and time – perhaps a thin film between worlds. The cloud appears to breathe as the 3-dimensional data shifts in and out, falling back to its original form only for a differential moment.</p>

              <p class = "text-light">Mirrored is a magical realist puzzle game based around perception and the physics of light, currently in early development, influenced by the stories of Jorge Luis Borges and Italo Calvino. The world is architectural and geometric, a city of reflections, invisible light, and unknown physical laws. The player uses perception to progress through the world. Doors here will only open if they can be seen from certain vantages; creatures inhabiting the city will move if they are not seen by the eye; and certain architectural elements only exist behind glass, and must be brought forth for the player to advance. On a technical level, the game explores the use of real-time ray-tracing as a game-mechanic. Ray-tracing, an algorithm invented by painters in the 16th century to faithfully capture reality, allows a way to fully simulate Newtonian/geometric optics, where light is abstracted as straight lines. Due to the computional cost of this algorithm, it has historically been used for offline rendering as opposed to real-time/interactive computer graphics. While the visual fidelity ray-tracing offers is substantial, the extent to which it might extend the domain of play in interactive mediums is often not discussed. The game is curently in development with the help of funding from the Centre of Digital Excellence (CODE).</p>

            <p class="text-light">I conducted research into real-time ray-tracing for my honours dissertation (2020), which culminated in a peer-reviewed publication (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8961032" >Real-Time Ray-tracing of Implicit Surfaces</a>), as well as building the foundations for me to develop my video game Mirrored, which extends this research into a video game (see Mirrored). I built a real-time bi-directional path-tracer in DXR and DX12, as well as an implementation of the paper <a href="https://casual-effects.com/research/McGuire2009Photon/ISPM-HPG09.pdf">Image Space Photon Mapping</a> in modern hardware. I then conducted research into geometric representations on the GPU and analysed the speed of these representations compared to the hardware accelerated triangle mesh representation. These geometries inlcuded algebraic, implicit and construcitve solid geometry. Constructive solid geometry does not trivially map to the GPU prorgramming because it typically is represented recurisvely, to solve this, I divised an algorithm that pre-processed the CSG tree (see the figure below) into a post-order sorted list on the CPU, which the GPU could then process iteratively. As mentioned, this work ultimately led me to wonder how real-time ray-tracing could modify how video games were played, instead of being simply a technology that added visual fidelity. I received $34,000 NZD of funding from the New Zealand Centre of Digital Excellence toward developing Mirrored, which experiments with these ideas.

              <p class="text-light">During my undergraduate I helped develop and research methods to reconstruct objects that are traditionally hard to image using structure from motion. The research was in the context of imaging debitage -- debris used in the analysis of stone tools by archeologists. The work led to a published peer reviewed paper (see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8961032" ><span class ="span-link">Stitching Partial 3D-Models</span></a>), and was as outlining proof of concept for the project to get the Marsden Fund from the New Zealand Royal Society. The image below illustrates the observed error against the reconstructed model using my method - where blue is closer to the ground-truth. The aim is to make sure metric information is maintained when a real object is reconstructed, allowing for precise and relevant measurements. In general this research intends to allow archeologists a ‘non-invasive’ means to study archeological sites, where they no longer need to appropriate artifacts from a site, but instead can image them with a camera and perform analysis off-site. This is both practically and culturally significant, where archeologists can use less resources, but also can cause less damage to culturally significant sites, especially those of indigenous groups as is the case with this research.

              <p class="text-light">Sine Rave was a 12 hour festival during an autumn night in Dunedin. Audience members were invited to fall asleep to ambient, embodying music.
                I wrote and performed a one hour piece (for cello and violin) with violinst Craig Monk (Dunedin Symphony Orchestra). The work had an interactive visual element, which invited audience members to control a shifting mass of points (developed in Unity with custom shaders) projected behind the performance. Audience members learnt to react to the music, extending the piece both collaboratively and cognitively.

              <p class="text-light">The ghosts of future trees is an extension to Epiphytic Memory. The work explores a dystopian future where the course of western colonial techno-patriarchy has destroyed earth’s living ecosystems. In this troubled world, distraught spirits of bygone beings are left to roam a desecrated earth. These ephemeral forms are reduced and stunted, shifting in and out of various collapsed organic permutations as they reminisce and mourn the loss of physical life. Humans in an effort to commune with these spirits and their lost physical forms, have created structures in the image of the ghosts they see (or feeble impressions of them).

               Hence the project is speculative and foreboding. The work consists of 3D-printed, translucent porcelain trees – derived from photogrammetric scans of sites in the Catlins, one of New Zealand’s largest remaining rain forests. The trees are responsive to environmental phenomena, much like the trees we know, yet their response is incorrect. They bioluminescence as a function of CO2, and communicate over a mycorrhizal network of light: the internet. These reactive qualities demonstrate feeble simulacrum, a drifting away and forgetting of those trees we know currently.
